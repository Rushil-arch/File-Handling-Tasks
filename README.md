# File Handling Tasks

## Task 1: Read a File and Handle Errors
This Python script opens and reads a text file named `sample.txt`, printing its content line by line. It handles errors gracefully if the file does not exist.

## Task 2: Write and Append Data to a File
This Python script takes user input and writes it to a file named `output.txt`. It then appends additional data to the same file and reads and displays the final content of the file.

## How to Run the Scripts
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Run the scripts using Python:
   ```sh
   python task1_read_file.py
   python task2_write_append.py
